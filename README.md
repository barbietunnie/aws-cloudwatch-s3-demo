# Cloudwatch Stream Demo

A proof-of-concept (POC) application that demonstrates writing 
log events to Amazon Cloudwatch and saving files to a particular 
S3 bucket, from a Javascript-based client app.

It uses *babel* to transpile ES6 to a compatible version of Javascript
to support older browsers and environments.

# Run
```
    npm run start
```
